                <h3>Terms of Commission</h3>
                <h5>I. Payment</h5>
                <p>
                    Payment is fully done through Paypal and in USD. To begin my work, half of the total payment is required upfront and the rest after the commission is fully completed. 
                    <br /><br />
                    This is done this way to ensure I, the artist, am not wasting time on a project that would be cancelled out of nowhere for no other reason than to bother the artist.
                </p>

                <h5>II. Work Time</h5>
                <p>
                    Commissions can take from a short amount of days to a couple of weeks depending on its complexity, and elements outside of my power (work, personal issues, etc.). You'll be notified of said changes if they occur. Revisions are welcome for up to 2-3 times, after that I'll have to charge you a quarter of the total price for the extra time spent on it. Please understand that I am more than happy to try to portray your vision with my hands, but my time isn't unlimited and I have other work to do. That's all.
                        <br /><br />
                    Simple revisions throughout the work process are understandable, but revisions after the artwork is done will often require an extra fee if they're big changes to the overall product, such as: outfits, characters, etc.
                </p>
                
                <h5>III. Refund</h5>
                <p>
                    Refunds are O.K. up 'til more than halfway through the commission. Whether that's by the end of the lineart process or beginning of coloring, etc. The "halfway" point also varies from the type of commision. Refunds will also be given if, for whatever extreme reason, I cannot finish the commission. In advance, I apologize if this ever happens and I will inform said refundee about the reason and refund.
                </p>

                <h5>IV. Art Copyright/Usage</h5>
                <p>
                    After the commission is well and done, you're free to use it however you see fit, but I would appreciate to still be credited for my work, even more if it's for commercial purposes. Leaving my signature is more than enough, but you're also free to spread the word that THIS loser made this drawing. Any small shoutout helps a ton!
                    <br /><br />
                    Do know that I am still own complete rights over the drawing itself. Therefore I am allowed to use the copyrighted artwork to; Promote myself with in any place or site. Publish books with. To display it anywhere to my liking. Post it wherever I want.
                    <br /><br />
                    The commissioner is allowed to use their commission for; Use for personal use only unless agreed otherwise. Print the art, and claim the right of their character/s but not the drawing itself. Use the art to promote themselves with proper credit given to the artist.

                <h3>General Knowledge</h3>

                <h5>I. Important Information</h5>
                <p>
                    I do not draw mechas, NSFW, among other extreme themes that should be quite obvious by now. If it's related to DnD/Fantasy stuff, then there's a high chance I can do it.
                    <br /><br />
                    Super niche stuff is up to debate with the artist.
                </p>

                <h5>II. General Idea</h5>
                <p>
                    To begin my work, I would like you to describe the character/s, whether it's word by word or through image references collected by yourself. The latter is preferable since the english language isn't my native one. Feel free to send me links with said references. Whether it'd be for poses, facial expressions, clothing, etc.
                    <br /><br />
                    Any specifics regarding clothing, scars, etc; are welcome and background ideas can also be described, but keep in mind that landscapes are not my strongest suit , but I'll strive to do my best.
                    <br /><br />
                    If you want to go the extra mile, feel free to describe your character/s backstory to me, so I get the vibe of the character/s that I am attempting to portray for you. It may not help a lot, but it help myself immerse into the character's vibe. 
                </p>
                
                <h5>III. Be Concise</h5>
                <p>
                    While revisions are allowed to a small degree, make sure you know what you want. Send as much reference artwork to the artist for them to work uninterrupted throughout the whole process. Late revisions will cost you extra, and the artist will have to work longer than anticipated. Nobody wins in that scenario, so do explore your options fully.
                </p>

                <h5>IV. Be Nice</h5>
                <p>
                    Please write in a clear and nice manner. I'm just a guy doing his best to make all of this work. I'm by no means a "professional" artist, so I just do this as a side thing for people that seem to enjoy my work.
                    <br /><br />
                    Any ill behaviour will not be tolerated and your commission will be canceled if it occurs. In the worst case scenario, I may block all contact and ability to make requests.
                    If you fail to follow the rules provided within this website page, I have the right to decline your commission.
